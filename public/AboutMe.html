    <div>My passion is designing communicative messages to client audiences in a clear, concise and expressive manner. Whatever your needs are, I will work with you individually to tailor the design specifically for your audience.
    </div>

    <div>My work experience in the New York publishing field and in the Chicago advertising industry has afforded me the opportunity to meet and work with a diverse group of design professionals. The common thread of both experiences was putting forth my best efforts on a daily basis to meet the expectations of a very competitive marketplace. I have been fortunate to make associations with many individuals who have found my freelance work to be both efficient and cost effective.
    </div>

    <div>My journey began at Wenner Media as their Promotion Designer in the Consumer Marketing Department. I served as a one-woman designer creating partnership promotional pieces, advertisements, direct mail campaigns, order pages, animated web banners and insert cards promoting subscription to Rolling Stone, Us Weekly, and Men’s Journal. My director was immediately drawn to a space ad concept for Rolling Stone that showcased popular covers on a bedroom wall. Jann Wenner soon chose to move forward with my concept and within one month I was directing the photoshoot and sending the final ad to production. The ad continued to run in the magazine for five years.
    </div>

    <div>Acknowledging the importance of working with other creatives, I accepted the Senior Designer position at Forbes. The experience I gained from working in the Creative Marketing Department greatly expanded my design and conceptual skills. Highlights include creating a motion graphic interactive media kit and designing a variety of advertorials that were published in Forbes.
    </div>

    <div>Between my experience at Wenner Media where the emphasis was on the consumer and at Forbes where the focus was geared towards the advertiser, I have gained an appreciation for the importance of both approaches.
    </div>

    <div>With few publishing opportunities available in Chicago I thought it would be beneficial to learn more about the advertising industry. During my two years at Cramer-Krasselt I worked on advertisements for their most influential clients including AirTran, Corona, Heinz, Hyatt, Porsche, and Sealy. In addition to the client work, I participated in the development of RFP’s and new business pitches. I now have a more solid understanding of the research and time dedicated to executing successful campaigns for the right demographics.
    </div>

    <div>In 2009 I made the decision to become a fulltime graphic design freelancer. My freelance began with work for Rolling
    Stone, Us Weekly, Men’s Journal, and Forbes. Through referrals, my publishing assignments have expanded to include
    projects for over 200 publications. In addition to projects for publishing clients, I have broadened my scope to
    assist with the marketing materials for The Execu|Search Group, print advertisements for Oneida, signage for Van
    Cleef & Arpels, and marketing materials for the kids show Space Racers.
    </div>

    <div>I have expanded my business by working on logo and brand identity for multiple new companies. I recognize the importance of strong branding and feel that many great companies are frequently overlooked based on their logos and marketing material. The first impression is often the most important one and my goal is for companies to get the awareness they deserve by creatively identifying their brand.
    </div>

    <div>I have benefited and grown professionally from the diversity of my experiences. Recognizing the budgets and time constraints on projects I am able to offer reasonable prices and deliver final material with short turn-around periods.
    </div>

    <div>I look forward to expanding my clientele and drawing from my experiences and design skills to best suit your needs.
