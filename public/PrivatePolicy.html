          Lauren Briddell, Inc. (hereinafter known as “Provider,” “us” or “we”) currently owns
          and operates the website known as www.laurenbriddell.com (the “Site”) To better protect
          your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
          choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this
          notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where
          personally identifiable information may be requested.
        </li>

          When you browse our web site, you do so anonymously. We do log your IP
          address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which
          part of our web site you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link
          your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our web site.
          Like many other commercial web sites, the Provider web site may use a standard technology
          called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to
          "Use of Cookies" below for more information.

      <ul>
       <li>To allow potential employers to see your information.</li>
       <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.</li>
       <li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you.</li>
       <li>To alert you of product upgrades, special offers, updated information

      <ul class="plainList">
        <li>
          We never sell or rent your personal information beyond allowing employers on the Site.
          Provider may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law
          (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or in good faith to (a) comply with legal
          processes served on the site, or (b) protect the rights and property of Provider, or
           (c) where our records indicate fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that
           a governmental agency should be made aware of, or (d) where your communication suggests
           possible harm to others.
         </li>
         <li>
          Provider may transfer information about Users if Provider is acquired by or merged with
          another company. Provider is not responsible for notifying User of such changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you register, Provider will not share your information with third parties without
            your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be
            used for the purposes stated above. We use personal information to reply to inquiries,
            handle complaints, provide operational notices, keep records up to date to notify you
            via periodic e-mails of technical service issues, specials, or other related
            product/service information. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors
            of Provider for the purpose of performing service for Provider.

          servers with limited access.
        </li>
        <li>
          You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your
          personal information without knowing your username and password, so do not share these with others.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use SSL encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card and
          personal information. Credit card numbers are only used for processing payment and are not
          used for other purposes. Our efforts to protect credit card fraud help protect your financial
          data security.
