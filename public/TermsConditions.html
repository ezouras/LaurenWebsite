      Any and all disputes or claims between you and LB arising out of, relating in any way to, or in connection with the Terms of Use, the Entities or your use of the Entities, or any material or services offered or distributed through the Entities (“Disputes”) shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration; except that you may bring a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court. By virtue of this Dispute Agreement (defined below), you and LB are each giving up the right to go to court and have a Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this section). 
      </div>
      <ul class="plainList">
        <li>The provisions of this section shall constitute your and LB’s written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“Dispute Agreement”). Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by you and LB.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to its rules, including, without limitation, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879. The arbitrator will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable law and the facts, and issue a reasoned award.
        </li>
        <li>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must comply with the limitations provision set forth in Section here and submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at http://www.adr.org, and simultaneously sending a copy of the completed form to LB at the address above. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
        </li>
        <li class="emphasize">
        No Class Action Matters. We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.
        </li>
        <li>
        Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court: (i) except with respect to a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court, you agree that any such Dispute may only be instituted in a state or federal court in Cook County, Illinois; (ii) you and LB irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for resolution of such Disputes; (iii) you and LB agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law and the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Dispute Agreement and any Disputes; and (iv) you and LB agree to waive any right to a trial by jury.
        </li>
        <li>
        Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Dispute Agreement, either party may bring suit in court seeking an injunction or other equitable relief arising out of or relating to the infringement of a party’s intellectual property or any conduct that violates any section of the Terms of Service.
        </li>
        <li>Time Limitations. If either of us wants to assert a Dispute against the other, the party with a Dispute must institute arbitration within one (1) year from the date the Dispute arose. Absent commencing the arbitration within one (1) year from the date the Dispute arose, the Dispute(s) will be forever barred.
